## Release note
**Jan 16, 2015: Version 1.0**

The first release of gRAICAR after a major reorganization. 

Key features:

- A GUI to input file paths and parameters
- Automatically generate html reports
- Manage multi-core computation

## Documentation
Please see _this tutorial_ for installing and running gRAICAR.

## Demonstration
An example dataset with 4 subjects is included in this repository, see the directory '_demo_'. 

This example shows recommended directory structure for gRAICAR analyses.

A configuration file, '_gRAICAR\_settings\_rest\_Jan.02.15-21.mat_', is included in '_demo/0scripts/_', which can be loaded into the GUI for performing the example analysis

Alternatively, one can run the batch file, '_batch_setup_gRAICAR.m_' to perform the example analysis without using GUI.

The output of the demonstration, including a webpage report, is in '_demo/output_'. Start browsing from '_demo/output/rest\_webreport/00index1.html_'.
